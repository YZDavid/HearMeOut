# HearMeOut (5648)
NUS 22/23 Orbital Project

**Level of Achievement**: Project Apollo 11 
**Project Scope**: HearMeOut aims to summarise text and convert it into audio with the use of Artificial Intelligence 

With the help of Artificial Intelligence Tools, large chunks of texts can be easily converted into smaller bite sized instead. In addition, it also enables users to have the option of hearing the summarized text instead. This is done with the help of libraries such as **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)** and  **gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)**
